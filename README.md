# AzureCasts #009: Freedom! Linux Edition

In episode #006 I told you that we couldn't use Azure's free tier, _F1_, unless we used the Windows operating system. Not a big deal if we're using Node and are happy to use Azure's canned hosting engine. But what if we want to do our own thing with Docker? Unfortunately that meant we were out of luck because Docker requires the Linux operating system, which wasn't free. Until 2 weeks ago!

In this episode we create a free Linux App Service and push a multi-container solution to it using Elixir and Redis.
